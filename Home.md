# Introduction #

The Wiki is for general development-related documentation for the game.

This is the Wiki Home.  Ideally, all other Wiki pages should be accessible from here.  Those that aren't can be found via the **[list of all Wiki pages](http://code.google.com/p/project6014/w/list)**.

**Spoiler warning!** There is heavy plot discussion in here.
