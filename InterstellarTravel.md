# Interstellar Travel #

Quasispace portals are sealed off. Instead, rapid transit can be achieved by travelling through Orzspace. Orzspace is accessed via portals in truespace star systems. You need [TemporalWrapper](TemporalWrapper.md) device (from [Ariloulaleelay](Ariloulaleelay.md)) to stay alive in Orzspace. It's a dangerous place...

In addition to ghosts of [Androsynth](Androsynth.md) and [Taalo](Taalo.md), [Orz](Orz.md) �fingers� roam the Orzspace. These appear as huge black holes that try to catch your vessel. Once you touch �em it�s game over for you, with an ominous cutscene.
