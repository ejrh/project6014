You'll start off in a non-moddable [ChmmrExplorer](ChmmrExplorer.md). Its only real capabilities will be interstellar travel, a bit of fighting, and landing on planets. Early on your Explorer will be destroyed and you'll get a moddable [PrecursorShip](PrecursorShip.md) in its place - much like the Vindicator.
