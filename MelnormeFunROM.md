[Fwiffo](Spathi.md) is in possession of five video games, one of which shares the fundamental code with the [Faz](Faz.md) VR. He color coded them because -- like most Spathi -- he can't remember their names properly.

The Captain has to make Fwiffo describe these games and refer to the Faz philosopher's description of his VR world. The Captain can use the matching game to predict events in the virtual reality and prove that it's an artificial illusion.

The games other than the right one play in universes similar to some of our real world games. Examples:

  1. Star Control 3 (might be fun listening to Fwiffo summarizing it -- especially it's flaws)
  1. [Archon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon:_The_Light_and_the_Dark)
  1. [Murder on the Zinderneuf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_on_the_Zinderneuf)
  1. "Frungy Championship Manager 2160"
