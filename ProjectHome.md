> _It is the year 2165._

> _Four years ago you travelled the galaxy, assembling the scattered forces of the old Alliance of Free Stars, striving to free the human race from Ur-Quan enslavement._

> _You succeeded._

> _The Ur-Quan fled, leaving their Hierarchy forces in disarray.  The Chmmr have emerged as the new leaders of known space and have asserted their authority._

> _Slave worlds have been freed.  And a new era of peace has emerged._

> _For their service to the Ur-Quan defense, Hierarchy battle thralls have been punished._

> _The New Alliance of Free Stars is rebuilding decimated homeworlds, and continues to drive out the scattered Ur-Quan from known space._

> _After many years of travelling the galaxy fighting the Ur-Quan, a peaceful life on Unzervalt with Talana beckons.  You have devoted your years to the study of Precursor technology, not willing to be involved in diplomacy, politics or military operations._

> _But your new life must wait._

> _Alliance command at Procyon has received a distress signal from a Shofixti scout deep in unknown space.  The urgent, garbled message refers to an enormous machine that destroyed several scout vessels upon contact.  Then... only static._

> _The Chmmr have asked YOU to lead an expedition to travel to the distress site far from Earth to track down the Shofixti and neutralize this artifact._

> _As you punch through the fabric of truespace, you wonder: Are you ready for this?_

## Demo 0.1 released! (1st Oct 2010) ##

[Get it here](http://code.google.com/p/project6014/wiki/Downloads)

Project 6014 has released a demo for three operating systems: Windows, Linux and OSX.  Although this is nowhere near the full game, it:

  * Explains the back story and reveals the galactic area of interest
  * Lets the player catch up with the races of the New Alliance of Free Stars
  * Implements a new flagship and adds a new alien ship to Melee
  * Gives the player a quest to complete
  * Introduces a new alien race!

As well as being a teaser, the demo will hopefully generate some interest in contributing to the full game!

"Project 6014" is both a plot-based game and a free software project.  This means we have a unique challenge in avoiding spoilers.  Please help us maintain the mystique of the upcoming game by not revealing anything that could ruin the story for others.  `:-)`
